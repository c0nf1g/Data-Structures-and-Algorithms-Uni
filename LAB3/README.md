# Depth First Search

### Description

Implement a program that finds a loop in a given oriented graph with depth search.

### Input data

The first line contains the number of edges *N*, *0 < N <= 10000*. The next *N* lines contain vertices pairs
connected by edges.

### Output data

List of vertices that form a cycle or False - if there are no cycles. In the graph where can be several cycles enough to output one of them.
